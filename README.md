# Data collection

* Name generator
* Position generator
* Resource generator


# Local neighborhoods

Ego-centric perspective on networks (also: data from name generator).
Definition of ego-networks, neighborhoods of different degree. 

Basic properties of ego-networks:

* size, 
* composition (with respect to node and/or edge attributes),
* homophily, 
* heterogeneity. 

Concepts of brokerage:

* effective size,
* efficiency,
* Burt’s constraint
* dyadic con- straint.





# Small-world phenomenon

High clustering, short geodesics.



# Friendship paradox

Why you friends have on average more friends than you do?



# Homophily and segregation

Bojanowski & Corten

Segregation and homophily as local and global characteristics of the network.
Mixing matrices. Segregation as dependence of edge probability on node at-
tributes.  Segregation as dependence between node attributes (mixing). Overview
of existing homophily and segregation measures: Freeman’s segre- gation index,
Coleman’s homophily index, assortativity coefficient, spectral segregation
index, and more.



# Cohesion

1. Cliques
2. groups
3. two-mode networks
	* "having something in common"
	* projections


# Fitting ERGMs with statnet
