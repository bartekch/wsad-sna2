# Local neighborhoods

Ego-centric perspective on networks. 
Definition of ego-networks, neighborhoods of different degree. 

Basic properties of ego-networks:

* size, 
* composition (with respect to node and/or edge attributes),
* homophily, 
* heterogeneity. 

Concepts of brokerage:

* effective size,
* efficiency,
* Burt’s constraint
* dyadic con- straint.




# Small-world phenomenon

High clustering, short geodesics.


# Friendship paradox

Why you friends have on average more friends than you do?


# Homophily and segregation

Bojanowski & Corten

Segregation and homophily as local and global characteristics of the network.
Mixing matrices. Segregation as dependence of edge probability on node at- tributes.
Segregation as dependence between node attributes (mixing). Overview of existing
homophily and segregation measures: Freeman’s segre- gation index, Coleman’s
homophily index, assortativity coefficient, spectral segregation index, and more.



# Cohesion

Cliques, groups, two-mode networks (


# ERGMs with statnet
